* Render micro-viz incrementally
  - with each new event, update DOM and fix heights of only the affected lines
    (should be straightforward)
  - animate, for bonus points :)

* Show "iteration lines"

* Add an example w/ pre-events, e.g.,

    for f()
    to: g()
    do: {
      ...
    }

  Will probably want to wrap pre-events in a LocalEventGroup, and distinguish between LEGs that
  start a new iteration, and those that don't.

* Figure out how to deal with new and init

* Write a nice explanation of the new / simplified algorithm

* Decide how to model nested scopes in JS, e.g., in js-reduce example
  (leaning towards "pretend sends" at the moment, probably w/ nice API in EventRecorder)
