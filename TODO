* Implement subsumption in RemoteEventGroup

* Figure out "compositing", i.e., how to show info from other (parent) envs

* Figure out how to deal with new and init

* Write a nice explanation of the new / simplified algorithm

* Render micro-viz incrementally
  - with each new event, update DOM and fix heights of only the affected lines
    (should be straightforward)
  - animate, for bonus points :)
