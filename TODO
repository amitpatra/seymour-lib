* Implement micro-viz view for new/

* Produce a nice explanation of the current algorithm

* Decide how to model nested scopes in JS, e.g., in js-reduce example
  (leaning towards "pretend sends" at the moment)

* Think about Saketh's "line group" abstraction
  -- maybe it's the way to get less rigid columns in the view?
