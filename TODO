* Produce a nice explanation of the current algorithm

* Use "Toby's trick" at the position (not line) level
  -- implement inside-out rule to prevent false iterations
  -- change view to take advantage of this (e.g., multiple events in a single TD)

* Think about adding more organization to the model

* Think about Saketh's "line group" abstraction
  -- maybe it's the way to get less rigid columns in the view?
